Requirements of the project

This checklist is here to help you feel confident that your project meets all the expectations. You can refer back to it as you build your page and mark items off as you complete them. The steps don’t need to be followed in a specific order, just make sure everything is included in the end. Most importantly, your final design should closely match the mockup, both on desktop and mobile screens.

Structure and Content

Use semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.)


Include a navigation bar with the WaveRiders logo and links: About, Courses, Shop, Contact


Add a hero section with a large heading, subtitle, and a “Book your lesson” button


Display a background image of waves in the hero section


Include a gallery section with two images of surfing squirrels


Add an about section explaining why to choose WaveRiders, with three feature blocks (icon, title, description)


Include a testimonials section with three short customer reviews inside styled cards


Add a footer with navigation links, social media icons or emojis, contact information, and a Google Map embedded using <iframe>

 Layout and Styling

Use Flexbox or Grid for layout across all main sections (navigation bar, hero, about, testimonials, footer)


Match the font, colors, and spacing from the mockup design


Add hover effects to footer links or icons


Use card-style boxes (e.g. border, shadow, background) for testimonials


Make sure the footer stays at the bottom of the page and never overlaps content

Accessibility and Semantics

Use appropriate HTML tags and structure for meaning, not just appearance


Add alt text to all images for accessibility


Keep content organized and readable with clear headings and sections

Responsive Design & CSS Best Practices

Use responsive units (%, em, rem, vh, vw) — avoid large fixed pixel values (especially over 50px)


Use media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens


Make sure elements stack vertically on mobile when needed (e.g. gallery images, about features, testimonials)


Ensure text scales properly and remains readable on all screen sizes


Test the layout using your browser’s responsive view (e.g. CodePen preview or DevTools)


The final result should match the design closely on both desktop and mobile
